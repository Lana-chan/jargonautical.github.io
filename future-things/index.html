      <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
      <p>The Thing From The Future is an imagination game for 1-6 players.
        The object of the game is to use the cards to generate the most
        interesting, funny or thought-provoking ideas for artifacts from the
        future. There are over 3.7 million possible prompts in the deck.
        <br><br>
        This tool will shuffle the deck for you and create a hand of four cards.
        <br><br>
        Look at your cards and see if you can create a brief description (and a
        sketch if you wish) of your thing from the future. This gets easier as
        your imagination warms up!
        <br><br>
        When everyone is ready, share your future thing ideas with the group.
        Share your favorite ideas with the gameplay community using the
        hashtag #FutureThing.

      <h5>ARC</h5>
      <p>
        Outlines the type of future world that the “thing” comes from,
        and how far away it is from today. There are four types of Arc, each an
        umbrella for countless possible scenarios:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Growth - a future in which “progress” has continued.</li>
        <li>Collapse – a future in which society as we know it has come apart.</li>
        <li>Discipline - a future in which order is deliberately coordinated or imposed.</li>
        <li>Transformation – a future in which a profound historical evolution has occurred.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>TERRAIN</h5>
      <p>
        The thematic context or location where this object could be
        found in that future.
      </p>
      <h5>OBJECT</h5>
      <p>
        The focus for your imagination: a specific cultural artifact
        that reveals something about how this future is different from today.
      </p>
      <h5>MOOD</h5>
      <p>
        Suggests how it might feel to experience this thing from the future.
