      <h4>WHAT IS IT?</h4>
      <p>The Thing From The Future is a game
        created by Stewart Candy and Jeff Watson at Situation Labs.
        The idea is to use the cards to generate the most
        interesting, funny or thought-provoking ideas for artifacts from the
        future.
        <br><br>
        When everyone is ready, share your future thing ideas with the group.
        You can share your favorite ideas with the gameplay community on
        Twitter using the hashtag #FutureThing.

        Use the 'Shuffle' button to deal yourself a hand of 4 cards, one from
        each of the suits - Arc, Terrain, Object and Mood.
        These set the scene for you to create a brief description (and a
        sketch if you wish) of your thing from the future. This gets easier as
        your imagination warms up!
        <br><br>
        ARC is the crucial suit; it describes the type of future world that
        the “thing” comes from, and how far away it is from today.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Growth: progress has continued at something like its current pace.</li>
        <li>Collapse: total breakdown. Society as we know it has come apart.</li>
        <li>Discipline: order is deliberately coordinated or imposed.</li>
        <li>Transformation: a profound historical evolution has occurred.</li>
      </ul>
