				One of my favourite things about open data is the unexpected value
				that comes from it - strange and wonderful things that people make
				from it, far removed from its original purpose. The LIDAR data
				released by the Environment Agency is a perfect example.
				<br><br>
				This dataset is a more-or-less complete topological survey of the
				landscape of the UK, collated over several years and released in
				well-structured and well-catalogued chunks available for anyone
				to download. A few years ago I became aware of this project by Chris
				Gutteridge, and his following adventures in writing a script that takes
				the LIDAR for a place and turns it into a virtual copy in a Minecraft
				world.
				<br><br>
				After taking a copy of the code and figuring out how to make it work,
				and having built more Minecraft versions of my home and my then-workplace
				than I could possibly use, I wondered what was next. Was it just a
				gimmick, or is there a legitimate practical use for it?

			<h3>Data Play</h3>
			<p>
				At Plymouth City Council's Data Play event in 2016 I got chatting to
				Leigh Cooper, a behavioural psychologist with an interest in education.
				We wondered, with the event's focus that year on environmental issues,
				whether we could come up with a project to combine our respective
				skills; something to engage local schoolchildren in caring for their local
				green spaces. I'd recently been introduced to the world of Minecraft
				mods (curated content packs that add new items to the base game) and
				we realised there was potential to provide a richer biosphere for
				players to explore.

				Recent innovative educational research has shown that Minecraft, the
				sandbox video game, can increase interaction with real-life spaces
				through modelling them in a virtual environment. Additionally,
				Minecraft has recently become a creative tool to promote understanding
				and engagement in real world ecological issues such as deforestation
				and climate change. Minecraft supports this engagement by offering a
				modifiable ecological system that includes a wide range of animal and
				bird life (including bees and butterflies) and plant life (including
				trees, flowers and aquatic plants), that can subsequently shape a
				variety of custom made forestry/conservation projects.
				This project aimed to utilise Minecraft, and the research behind it,
				to encourage school students at Prince Rock Primary School, to engage
				and interact with an outdoor green space (Teats Hill) and address
				current ecological issues.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project aimed to produce a workshop that could be taken and
				implemented across multiple schools. It served as a pilot project to
				provide insights into how this scheme might be upscaled for wider
				applications. The project included two phases, a Field Trip workshop
				and a Minecraft workshop.
				Data were collected in the form of anonymous questionnaires and
				observations before and after each phase. This was to ensure that the
				project adhered to evidence-based methods, allowing us to measure the
				effectiveness of the project.
				A group of 10 students (aged 9-10) took part in both phases of this
				project. The two phases are outlined below:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Field Trip workshop<br>
				The first phase of the project involved a field trip to the chosen
				green zone, Teats Hill park. This workshop lasted 3 hours from
				12:00pm-3:00pm. We wanted to take the students to Teats Hill, before
				they partook in the Minecraft workshop, to get them familiar with Teats
				Hill and to allow them to explore it before they explored the virtual
				copy.
				The students engaged in ecological surveying activities that allowed
				them to observe and record what was in and around the area, including
				animals, types of habitats, plants, and play equipment. One of the main
				focuses of this surveying task was to capture the ideas the students
				had to improve the area of Teats Hill and to show them what types of
				wildlife live on their doorstep.
				Students were asked to fill in small tally charts for the type of
				species/habitats they observed. Additionally, qualitative data on the
				suggested improvements to Teats Hill were collected through verbal
				interviews and focus groups with the students.
				The students also took part in a marine habitat activity that involved
				them learning about the different marine species in the UK’s oceans and
				coasts. This also included exploring the rock pools around Teats Hill
				and discovering the variety of wildlife that live there. This activity
				was put together and led by a member of the Marine Biological
				Association (MBA), Eliane Bastos.
				The intention of this phase was to allow the students to learn and
				explore the ecosystem of Teats Hill and ask the question “What could we
				improve?”. Engaging the students in this intrinsic manner was
				hypothesised to increase the likelihood of them exploring Teats Hill
				independently in the future.
			</li>
			<li>Minecraft workshop<br>
				The second phase in this project involved a Minecraft workshop, where
				the students explored a virtual reconstruction of Teats Hill park
				created inside Minecraft. This workshop took place at Prince Rock
				Primary School in their IT suite. The workshop lasted 3 hours,
				from 9:00am-12:00pm.
				The students were offered a range of tasks that they could choose to
				tackle, but they were also encouraged to explore the Minecraft world
				independently. The tasks included encouraging bee colonies to thrive
				and produce honey, constructing playground equipment, building a
				galleon, and harvesting/growing wild vegetables/flowers.
				During this workshop, the students were reminded of the observations
				they made during the field trip workshop and told that they could use
				that information to influence the Minecraft version of Teats Hill.
				Questionnaires were filled in before and after the workshop session to
				gather feedback on the student’s experience, their thoughts on Teats
				Hill, and what they learnt from the workshops.
			</li>
		</ol>
			<p>
				There were two main issues that we wanted to address with this project
				- to spark an interest with students to engage with green spaces and
				to encourage interest in current ecological issues.
				To gain some insight into these issues, we performed thematic analysis
				on the data collected during the project. Thematic analysis involves
				collating the data into identifiable groups to examine observable
				patterns. We did this in order to examine how the students interacted
				with the project and what parts of the project the students preferred.
				From their responses and our observations, we grouped the student
				interactions into four themes:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Explorer<br>
				  Students that showed high levels of curiosity and exploration inside of
				  Minecraft and at Teats Hill.
				</li>
				<li>
					Builder<br>
					Students that were interested in constructing buildings, objects,
					and structures inside Minecraft. Focused on the creation side of the
					game.
				</li>
				<li>
					Engineer<br>
					Students that displayed interest in the Minecraft mods (windmills,
					renewable energy etc.,) and tinkering with more advanced tools.
				</li>
				<li>
					Conservationist<br>
					Students that learnt and interacted with the wildlife inside of
					Minecraft and in Teats Hill. This involved planting flowers and
					caring for bee hives.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				There are two main points to take away from the themes stated above:
				It is clear that our sample of 10 students had varying interests when
				it came to exploring Minecraft and Teats Hill. As a result, this
				presents an opportunity to tailor another future project to fit these
				wants and needs. For instance, creating another virtual park in
				Minecraft and establishing specific tasks for the students to perform
				that would nurture and encourage their exploring, building,
				engineering, and/or conservation interests. By doing this, it is
				possible to foster individual intrinsic motivation towards learning
				about ecological issues and local green spaces by focusing on their
				particular interests.
				These themes emerged from the data collected during the Field trip
				workshop and the Minecraft workshop. Hence, we have supported the idea
				that a student’s interests in the real world, overlap into the realm
				of simulated worlds. This further supports the validity of using
				Minecraft as an educational tool in classrooms, to address important
				factors relating to the real world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before we started this project, we sent out some questionnaires to the
				students parents. These questionnaires asked about the types of
				activities the students get up to outside of school, their video game
				habits, and the parents interactions with the students. A couple of
				key insights arose from the answers to the questionnaires. Firstly,
				it became apparent that the student’s hobbies/interests (outside of
				school) were reflected inside of Minecraft and during the Teats Hill
				field trip workshop. For instance, parents mentioned that their
				children “loves exploring”, “finding stuff”, “reading about animals
				and plants”, and “discovering new things”. All of these statements
				were observed by us throughout the whole project, specifically during
				the Minecraft workshops. This emphasises how well Minecraft emulates
				real world interests in children and by using as an education tool
				you use those interests to foster an excitement for the local park
				that Minecraft is emulating. Another point that iterates the use of
				Minecraft as an educational tool is that parents response to the
				question “What phrase best describes your child when it comes to
				playing video games?”; 100% of parents answered “They love video
				games”. By using a tool that children already enjoy we make it
				even easier to overlap the virtual and real world as the motivation
				for interaction is already present.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the Minecraft workshop we observed a variety of student
				behaviours that reflected their observations from the Field Trip
				workshop. For instance, one student was keen to implement various
				sea-life in the Minecraft world (crabs, sea gulls etc.,); which is
				something we discussed and observed at the real-life Teats Hill. Other
				examples of this manifested itself in planting wild flowers and caring
				for bee colonies; as students mentioned that they would like to see
				more examples of wild flowers and insects in Teats Hill. All of these
				behaviours can be seen in the Minecraft screenshots below. This
				demonstrates that the majority of students are interested in their
				local green spaces and that there is a great opportunity to transfer
				these behaviours, from virtual worlds to the real-life green space.
				Encouraging students to consider real problems and find solutions for
				virtual wildlife and green spaces, also fosters intrinsic motivation
				to engage in these areas.
				However, one area of improvement for this project and further projects
				would be to implement a method of data collection to observe the
				physical impact this scheme had on the quantitative footfall of the
				chosen green space, Teats Hill. Unfortunately, due to limitations in
				logistics and a small sample size, we were unable to quantify the
				footfall to Teats Hill. We could only assume motivations to explore
				Teats Hill through qualitative measures.
			</p>
			<p>
				Impact of a virtual world
				As previously stated, we focused on a number of tasks during the
				Minecraft workshop to encourage interaction with the Minecraft version
				of Teats Hill and promote curiosity in nature. These tasks included
				caring for bee hives, planting wildflowers, building playground
				equipment, and creating a galleon.
				The data collected showed that these tasks were very successful in
				getting the students to think, learn, and explore. For instance, when
				asked the question “What was the best thing you learnt from playing
				Minecraft today?” one student replied “I really liked learning about
				the bee hives. I liked checking them every now and then”.
				Additionally, when asked the question “What was your favourite thing
				to do in Minecraft?” one student responded “I like making the slide
				and shelter” whilst another student answered “build new things and
				see new things”. This exemplifies the use of Minecraft as an
				educational tool and an instrument in promoting local green spaces.
				Minecraft allows you to exhibit a local green space from novel
				perspectives, allowing individuals to interact with it in different
				ways thus, promoting curiosity in that space.
				In terms of promoting footfall to Teats Hill, when asked “Would you
				like to go back to Teats Hill after exploring it in Minecraft?” a
				significant majority of the students replied “Yes”. A similar
				response was also received when asking the question “Would you like to
				explore Teats Hill again inside of Minecraft?”. Again, this
				illustrates how powerful Minecraft is; it sparks curiosity in children
				and allows them to discover real-world topics and concepts through a
				different process.
			</p>
			<p>
				Project implications
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Minecraft is a successful tool for promoting green space use and
					ecological issues
				</li>
				<li>
					Minecraft must be used in conjunction with a field trip
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This project pilot from late 2017 has been fully funded and supported by Plymouth
				City Council through the Data Play programme.
