# OPEN DATA DEMO
## A placeholder for now
We'll be filling this in with sample data from providers such as Open Corporates, Office for National Statistics and 
The Data Place. We'll also add some visualisations to show how these can be used. This is aimed at social enterprises 
and other small non-profit organisations who are interested in using open data for their business intelligence and 
evidence base activity.
