    <h2>Making use of open data</h2>
    <h3>Data Mince: the basics</h3>
    <p>
      A long time ago, my brother went off to university and started learning to shop,
      cook and stay alive on a student's budget. He found out that pretty quickly
      he fell into a pattern; after a long day of lectures and coursework and
      assignments he would realise it was time to cook dinner. He'd chop an onion
      and start frying it, add some cheap beef mince to the pan ... and then realise
      he hadn't decided what he was actually going to cook. Chilli? Spag bol? Maybe go all
      out and make cottage pie? His basic fried-mince-and-onion was just the
      starting point.
      <br><br>
      When I started working on projects for different clients, no
      matter how sophisticated the toolset or how complex the problem, I
      almost always need to start with the same initial collection of demographic
      data; population, income, deprivation, working patterns and so on. This is
      the 'data mince'.
  </p>
  <h3>Local focus</h3>
    <p>
      With the aim of making good-quality open data accessible to a wider audience,
      here's a quick look at easily-available open demographic data on Plymouth and
      broken down by ward. This is just the basics: population by five-year age bands from
      the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and the Indices of Multiple
      Deprivation from the UK Government's Department for Levelling Up,
      Housing and Communities (DLUHC).
      <br><br>
      All of the data here is published under the
      <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Open Government Licence</a>
      as open data.

    <h3>Measures of disadvantage</h3>
      <p>
        The Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) are updated every few
        years and cover a wider range of measures including environment, barriers to
        opportunity, health and crime.<br><br>
        The top-level index of deprivation is calculated from a combination of the
        contributing measures, and assigns every Lower-level
        Super Output Area (LSOA) in England a score based on how deprived the model says
        the area is in comparison to all the others. With all the LSOAs ranked in order,
        each one is then assigned to a decile with a numeric score from 1 to 10.
        Any LSOA with a decile score of 1 is then said to be in the top 10% most deprived
        nationally, and a decile score of 10 would be in the 10% least deprived.<br><br>

<p>
  Working in the data science field in the middle of a global pandemic, there
  are many opportunties to start building tracking dashboards and viral
  infection models. But there are enough of those already, so we're focusing on
  how we can provide something useful to anyone trying to manage service demand or
  community responses to the current crisis.<br><br>
  We'll update this periodically as we find new and useful things to add to it,
  but for now here are the basics:<br>
  - population,<br>
  - deprivation<br>
  - economic activity.<br><br>
  All of the data we use here is published under the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Open Government Licence</a> as open data.

<h3>Looking at population variation</h3>

<div id="pop-section" class="flex-container">

  <div class="box">
    <p>We always find it useful to look at the distribution of ages
      rather than the absolute values; the shape of a place's age
      profile tells you a lot when you compare it to the wider
      area. For example, Exeter and Plymouth stand out in this chart
      because of the much higher numbers of resident young people
      due to the universities. Torbay on the other hand has a profile skewed
      towards the older age ranges, as many people retire to the area.<br><br>

      If we were looking at something like vulnerability profiles, then both groups
      would be of interest. Outbreaks like the coronavirus are particularly concerning
      for the elderly and anyone with an underlying health condition, but young people
      are by no means immune. In fact a university environment can carry extra risks,
      e.g. dorms, house shares, group tutorials and lectures in spaces that see a
      lot of use.

<h3>Economic vulnerability and differential impacts</h3>


<div id="emp-section" class="flex-container">

  <div class="box">
    <p>
      Health isn't the only vulnerability factor; for many people self-employment,
      freelance and contracting work and zero-hours contracts have become a standard
      part of their income generation. To take a look at the potential numbers of
      people affected we can use the ONS Annual Labour Survey data - latest is for
      the year from October 2018 to September 2019.<br><br>
      Source: <a href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=141">ONS UK Business Counts</a>

  <div class="box">
    <p>
      These charts show two different attributes of the UK Business Counts data;
      the breakdown by legal status, which gives us the proportion of sole traders
      in a district, and the size band by number of employees so we can see where
      there's a high proprotion of businesses with, for example, fewer than 5 people
      working there.

<h3>Other measures of disadvantage</h3>

<div id="imd-section" class="flex-container">

  <div class="invisbox">
    <h3>Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)</h3>
    <p>
      Income and employment are far from the only measure of wellbeing - although they certainly make a
      difference. The Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) are updated every few
      years and cover a wider range of measures including environment, barriers to
      opportunity, health and crime.<br><br>
      The top-level index of deprivation is calculated from a combination of the
      contributing indices, and assigns every small area (LSOA or Lower-level
      Super Output Area) in England a score based on how deprived the model says
      the area is in comparison to all the others. With all the LSOAs ranked in order,
      each one is then assigned to a decile with a numeric score from 1 to 10.
      Any LSOA with a decile score of 1 is therefore in the top 10% most deprived
      nationally; and the higher the decile score, the less deprived.<br><br>
      This chart looks at how many LSOAs per district fall into which deciles, so we can see
      that the more urban areas like Torbay and Plymouth have a far greater
      proportion of LSOAs with lower decile scores.<br>
