    <h3>Using open data to understand a place</h3>
    <p>
    Something I have found when I work on projects for different clients, no
    matter how sophisticated the toolset or how complex the problem, I
    almost always need to start with the same initial collection of demographic
    data; population, income, deprivation, working patterns and so on. This is
    your starter kit for understanding some of the patterns in the location you're 
    trying to analyse;<br>
    - population,<br>
    - deprivation<br>
    - economic activity.<br>
    <br>
    All of the data I use here is UK government open data, published under the 
    <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Open Government Licence</a> as open data.

  <h3>Population variations by age</h3>

  <div id="pop-section" class="flex-container">

    <div class="invisbox">
      <p>I always find it useful to look at the distribution of ages
        rather than the absolute values; the shape of a place's age
        profile tells you a lot when you compare it to the wider
        area. For example, Exeter and Plymouth stand out in this chart
        because of the much higher numbers of resident young people
        due to the universities. Torbay on the other hand has a profile skewed
        towards the older age ranges, as many people retire to the area.<br><br>

        If we were looking at something like vulnerability profiles, during COVID for 
        example, then both groups
        would be of interest. Viral outbreaks are particularly concerning
        for the elderly and anyone with an underlying health condition, but young people
        are by no means immune. In fact a university environment can carry extra risks,
        e.g. dorms, house shares, group tutorials and lectures in spaces that see a
        lot of use.

  <h3>Economic vulnerability and differential impacts</h3>


  <div id="emp-section" class="flex-container">

    <div class="invisbox">
      <p>
        Health isn't the only vulnerability factor; for many people self-employment,
        freelance and contracting work and zero-hours contracts have become a standard
        part of their income generation. To take a look at the potential numbers of
        people affected we can use the ONS Annual Labour Survey data - latest is for
        the year from October 2023 to September 2024<br><br>

        These charts show two different attributes of the UK Business Counts data;
        the breakdown by legal status, which shows us the proportion of sole traders
        in a district, and the size band by number of employees so we can see where
        there's a high proportion of businesses with, for example, fewer than 5 people
        working there.

      <h3>Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)</h3>
      <p>
        Income and employment are far from the only measure of wellbeing - although they certainly make a
        difference. The Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) are updated every few
        years and cover a wider range of measures including environment, barriers to
        opportunity, health and crime.<br><br>
        The top-level index of deprivation is calculated from a combination of the
        contributing indices, and assigns every small area (LSOA or Lower-level
        Super Output Area) in England a score based on how deprived the model says
        the area is in comparison to all the others. With all the LSOAs ranked in order,
        each one is then assigned to a decile with a numeric score from 1 to 10.
        Any LSOA with a decile score of 1 is therefore in the top 10% most deprived
        nationally; and the higher the decile score, the less deprived.<br><br>
        This chart looks at how many LSOAs per district fall into which deciles, so we can see
        that the more urban areas like Torbay and Plymouth have a far greater
        proportion of LSOAs with lower decile scores.<br>
