    <h3>So, what do you do now?</h3>
      <p>
        Okay, to keep pushing the shopping analogy - maybe the shop doesn't
          have a 'Milk' shelf. Perhaps it has a 'Dairy' aisle.
          Maybe it's not a corner shop at all, but rather a petrol station with a
          fridge marked 'Essentials' where the milk is kept along with the
          sausage rolls and the energy drinks. Maybe you actually need almond milk,
          or soya, and those are kept in a completely different section
          called 'Alternatives to dairy'. Until you get there it's difficult to know.

          That's what the API documentation is supposed to do - it acts as a
          guide to the layout of the store, so to speak, and
          what products you might expect to find on which shelves.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to this, the department we need is called 'dairy' and
          once we get there we want to look in 'products', then find the actual product name we're looking for.
          So we need to specify both the 'department' and the 'product' in our API call.

        Putting all that together, our request is going to look something like this:
