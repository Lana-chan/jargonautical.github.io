                <h3>How do people find time to write?</h3>
                <p>
                    A couple of years ago I took up writing fiction, something I used to 
                    enjoy but gradually stopped because I simply didn't have the time any more. 
                    There was no particular goal in mind, and 
                    I didn't see it as anything other than a hobby. Eventually 
                    though, I got to the point where a story appeared to be complete, 
                    so I went ahead and published it. I quickly discovered that it's a 
                    very common path for new authors to find 
                    that they have more books in them than they realised! I now have a 
                    sequel in development, and several other works in progress, and 
                    obviously that has an impact on how I manage my time.
                    <br><br>
                    I got curious. Just how many hours exactly are involved in writing 
                    a novel? And more to the point, how much of that is actually writing 
                    (the fun part), and how much is proof-reading, editing, typesetting, 
                    and of course the dreaded marketing?

        <div class="flex-container">

                <h4>Do I have the data?</h4>
                <p>
                    Thankfully, yes. I keep a daily log of tasks and time spent on each one, so I 
                    already have a complete and structured collection of data points to work 
                    with.

                <h4>What am I trying to investigate?</h4>
                <p>
                    Since I have the data, next I need to decide what questions 
                    I'm trying to answer with it. 
                    Let's start with some obvious ones:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            How many hours does it take to create a novel?  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What proportion of that is writing, compared to all the other tasks?  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do I get more done during the week, or at weekends? 
                        </li>
                        <li>What about holidays, or Christmas?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <div class="invisbox-big">
                <h4>Do I have the code?</h4>

                    There are many talented data people out there, and one of them, 
                    <a href="">Giuseppe Solazzo</a>, recently created 
                    <a href="https://www.letsmakeamap.com/blog/end-of-year-dataviz">this lovely radial chart
                    showing his fitness tracker steps for 2024</a>. He was inspired by 
                    <a href="https://dominicroye.github.io/blog/climate-circles/index.html">Dominic Royé's work plotting 
                    climate circles</a>, and the visualisation and calculations are all done in R.
                    <br><br>
                    In my work I tend to work a lot more in Python, and luckily for me 
                    <a href="https://tomicapretto.com/">Tomás Capretto</a> had 
                    already looked into coverting a very similar R visualisation by 
                    <a href="https://www.cedricscherer.com/">Cédric Scherer</a> into Python.
                    <br><br> 
                    <a href="https://python-graph-gallery.com/web-circular-lollipop-plot-with-matplotlib/">Here is Tomás's example</a> 
                    which is already very close to what I wanted to do. The data in this example deals with the amount of 
                    time it takes to crack certain categories and formats of passwords, but all the necessary elements 
                    are there for me to deconstruct and tweak for my purposes.

        <h3>The result</h3>
        <p>
            What does it tell us? To start with, you can see that I didn't start recording the time I spent on 
            writing and related tasks until April 2024. You can also see that I don't find 
            the time to write every single day; even 
            once I'd started logging time in those categories, there are still gaps.

                <h3>How many hours does it take to create a novel?</h3>
                <p>
                    In this case, 444 hours (and counting, since technically the current 
                    WIP isn't finished yet). That said, some people do write faster; and not 
                    every author would count all of the activities that I've been logging 
                    as 'writing'. Which leads me to the next question:
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What proportion of that is writing, compared to all the other tasks?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Plotting, outlining, typesetting, 
                    cover designs, proof-reading, uploading files, and marketing are all 
                    part of the process if you're self-published. The bar chart to the right 
                    of the radial plot shows the breakdown of total hours by catgory.
                    <br><br>
                    It is interesting to see the numbers, and there are a couple of surprises. 
                    Drafting and editing make up the majority of the hours, as I would expect. 
                    Marketing - which includes social media posts, designing ads, and editing 
                    photographs - looks tiny. In fact this 
                    is an almost daily activity, but usually only for a few minutes at a time. 
                    If I reproduce this diagram for 2025 later on, I expect that number will be  
                    significantly higher.
                    <br><br>
                    I am shocked by how little time I apparently spend outlining and plotting, 
                    possibly something I need to address!            
                </p>

            <div class="invisbox">
                <h3>
                    Do I get more done during the week, or at weekends? What about 
                    holidays, or Christmas?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I don't typically get more writing done at weekends versus weekdays, 
                    as you might have imagined, but then my working week is quite flexible. 
                    The graph shows that it's very common for there to be short bursts of
                    four hours or less - that usually means I found a little free time in the evening.
                    <br><br>
                    For lines of more than four hours on a weekday, possibly I had a free day with no 
                    paid work to focus on. That said, there are also days where the conditions were 
                    perfect and I was writing and editing late into the night because it was all 
                    flowing so beautifully!
                    <br><br>
                    Where there are several days in a row with a lot of writing hours, that's when I  
                    made a conscious decision to take time off to focus on writing. That happened in June 2024, 
                    when I booked a week off work and stayed in a hotel, and another occasion in October 2024 
                    when I had my regular gaming getaway with friends.
