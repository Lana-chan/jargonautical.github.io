                <h2>Finding time to write</h2>
            </div>

        <div class="flex-container">

                <p>
                    A couple of years ago I took up writing again. 
                    <br><br>
                    This is something I used to 
                    enjoy, but gradually stopped because I simply didn't have the time any more. 
                    When I picked it up again I had no particular goal in mind,  
                     other than as a hobby. Eventually 
                    though, I ended up writing a complete story, 
                    so I went ahead and published it. 
                    <br><br>
                    At this point I discovered that it's very common for debut authors to find 
                    that they have more books in them than they realised! I now have a 
                    sequel in development, and several other works in progress, and 
                    obviously that has an impact on how I manage my time.
                    <br><br>
                    Once I started looking into my progress on each project, and with one 
                    eye on my timesheets, I got curious. Just how many hours are involved in writing 
                    a novel? More to the point, how much of that is actually writing 
                    (the fun part), and how much is proof-reading, editing, typesetting - 
                    and, of course, the dreaded marketing?
                    <br><br>
                    Since I track the time I spend working for different client, I decided to start 
                    keeping a record of writing in the same way, treating it as just another work 
                    project, and with enough data I could analyse it in the same way that I do for 
                     paying contracts. Thanks to that, I already have a complete, 
                    detailed, and structured collection of data points to work with.                     
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="invisbox">

            <div class="invisbox">
                <p>
                    I started with date, project, activity and the number of hours.
                    <br><br>
                    I used Pandas to convert the date to a proper datetime object 
                    then add the day number and day name against each entry, and 
                    the month name against the first day of each month.
                    <br><br>
                    This isn't essential for the analysis, but it gives me a way 
                    to differentiate weekdays from weekends in the final result, as 
                    well as placing labels for the months.

                    Now, on to the code. Normally in my analysis I aim to work backwards from the 
                    questions I want to answer, but in this case I was partly inspired by 
                    <a href="https://www.letsmakeamap.com/blog/end-of-year-dataviz">this post by Giuseppe Solazzo</a>
                     showing his fitness tracker steps for 2024, and he was inspired in turn by 
                    <a href="https://dominicroye.github.io/blog/climate-circles/index.html">Dominic Royé's work plotting 
                    climate circles</a>. In both of these examples, the visualisation and calculations are all done in R.
                    <br><br>
                    On the other hand, I tend to work a lot more in Python. Luckily for me 
                    <a href="https://tomicapretto.com/">Tomás Capretto</a> had 
                    already looked into coverting a very similar R visualisation by 
                    <a href="https://www.cedricscherer.com/">Cédric Scherer</a> into Python.
                    <br><br> 
                    <a href="https://python-graph-gallery.com/web-circular-lollipop-plot-with-matplotlib/">Here is Tomás's example</a> 
                    which is already very close to what I wanted to do. The data in this example deals with the amount of 
                    time it takes to crack certain categories and formats of passwords, but all the necessary elements 
                    are there for me to deconstruct and tweak for my purposes.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The length of each line represents the amount of time (seconds, minutes, hours, days
                            or years) needed to crack each password in the dataset. I can use this for the number 
                            of 'writing hours' per day.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The angle of the line in relation to the starting point represents the position of the 
                            password entry in the dataset's index, so I can order my data in date order and use the 
                            same process to make sure everything shows up in the right place on the radial chart. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This example uses a custom colour map of ten different shades, but I only need two - 
                            one for weekdays, and another for weekends. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="invisbox">

                    Next I need to decide what questions 
                    I'm trying to answer with this data. More specifically, what questions do I 
                    think would be well-answered by the radial chart I'm planning to create?
                    <br><br>
                    Here are the obvious ones:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            How many hours does it take to create a novel?  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What proportion of that is writing, compared to all the other tasks?  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do I get more done during the week, or at weekends? What about holidays, or Christmas?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    Let's start not at the beginning, but with the second question. This one 
                    is better answered with a simple bar chart, at least to begin with.
                    <br><br>
                    Plotting, outlining, typesetting, 
                    cover designs, proof-reading, uploading files, and marketing are all 
                    part of the process if you're self-published. The bar chart to the right 
                    shows the breakdown of total hours by category.
                    <br><br>
                    It is interesting to see the numbers, and there are a couple of surprises. 
                    Drafting and editing make up the majority of the hours, as I would expect. 
                    Marketing - which includes social media posts, designing ads, and editing 
                    photographs - looks tiny. In fact this 
                    is an almost daily activity, but usually only for a few minutes at a time. 
                    If I reproduce this diagram for 2025 later on, I expect that number will be  
                    significantly higher.
                    <br><br>
                    I am shocked by how little time I apparently spend outlining and plotting, 
                    possibly something I need to address!

                <h4>What does it tell us?</h4>
                <p>
                    To start with, you can see that I didn't start recording the time I spent on 
                    writing and writing-related tasks until April 2024. You can also see that I don't find 
                    the time to write every single day; even 
                    once I'd started logging time in those categories, there are still gaps. 
                </p>
                <h4>How many hours does it take to create a novel?</h4>
                <p>
                    In this case, 444 hours (and counting, since technically the current 
                    WIP isn't finished yet). That said, some people do write faster; and not 
                    every author would count all of the activities that I've been logging 
                    as 'writing'.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Do I get more done during the week / at weekends / during 
                    holidays / at Christmas?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I don't typically get more writing done at weekends versus weekdays, 
                    as you might have imagined, but then my working week is quite flexible. 
                    The graph shows that it's very common for there to be short bursts of
                    four hours or less - that usually means I found a little free time in the evening.
                    <br><br>
                    For lines of more than four hours on a weekday, possibly I had a free day with no 
                    paid work to focus on. That said, there are also days where the conditions were 
                    perfect and I was writing and editing late into the night because it was all 
                    flowing so beautifully!
