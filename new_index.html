  <h2>Making sense of data</h2>

		  <p>
			  What do we mean by 'making sense of data'? It can't be that complicated. 
			  Surely that's what graphs and stuff are for ... just shove your data into 
			  some  kind of chart and the job is done, right?
			  <br>
			  As it turns out - no, not really.
			  <br>
			  Data visualisation is about so much more than visualising data. 
			  It's a commmunication, a set of design choices around brand and audience, 
			  and most of all it's a response.
			  <br>
			  What question does your chart answer?<br>
			  What problem does it solve?<br>
			  Who will look at it and as a result feel ready to take action or make a decision?<br>
			  <br>
			  To explore this point, here's an example using some data from my real life.
			  I spend several hours a day playing Destiny 2, an online MMORPG first-person shooter.
			  Like many games in this genre it has a player-versus-player (PvP) mode where you can 
			  test your skills against other players in a controlled arena separate from the main 
			  story missions. Tensions run hot in this type of mode, and accusations of cheating are commonplace.
			  <br>
			  Being a middle-aged gamer with below-average reflexes, I frequently come off worse in these competitions, and 
			  of course that's very frustrating. Sometimes I find myself matched against people so skilled, so godly, that 
			  I never stood a chance of beating them. When that happens I find myself hovering over the 'Report' button and 
			  asking myself, 'Do I really believe they're cheating, or am I just salty about losing?'.

		  <h4>There's a question to be answered!</h4>
		  <p>
			One thing that sets Destiny as a game apart from many others is its very rich, well-structured and 
			  well-documented API. With a developer account I can access huge amounts of game data for myself and other 
			  players, and using that I can do pretty much any analysis that takes my fancy.
			  <br>
			  This is a very dangerous scenario for any data scientist. All this data, and no clear question ...
			  <br>
			  I wondered if it would be possible to extract the right data to analyse who the likely cheats are in 
			  the games I'd played recently. That sort of thing would show up in their game statistics, right? Simple. 
			  All I needed to do was extract all of the game stats and then try some different models until I got an answer.
			  
			  For the machine learning bit, I ran through various different model and data structures before admitting that, 
			  actually, I couldn't identify any particular pattern.
			  <br>
			  This just in - good players tend to be good, more at ten.
			  <br>
			  And the more I tweaked the models, the more I lost sight of the problem I was originally trying to solve. 
			  I also developed immense sympathy for the developers who work on anti-cheat tools!

			  existing trackers - great at pulling out info but use ELO and also have
			  lots of ads and moving banners. plus you need to stay logged in so you can get your results faster.
			  my version will be simple look up with my own data already loaded and ready to call on
			  (show new version once I have this done)

			  So if my analysis isn't answering my question, what does? 
			  Time to go back and reframe the question. 
			  <br>
		  </p>
		  <h4>What do I really want to know?</h4>
		  <p>
			  Firstly: should I have expected this person to beat me?<br>
			  Signs for that include:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>Are they using the meta?</li>
			  <li>Are they are using known  exploits?</li>
			  <li>Are they at a significantly higher level than me?</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>
			  If one or more of those things is true, perhaps I just need to 'git gud' ...

		  <p>
			  One way to explore possible answers to these questions is to look at someone's game history 
			  to see whether their win status or their kill count seems feasible. Some  of the other tracker 
			  sites include a player's Elo ranking, which many take as a relevant metric. I prefer not to, however, 
			  and here's why. It only counts wins and losses. Win a game, and you move up.  Lose a game and you move down. 
			  In a team game, where there can be (depending on the specific mode) 4 or 6 players on each side, it's far 
			  too blunt an instrument. 
			  Someone with a high success rate could simply have been teamed up with very high-skill players - a 'carry', 
			  where the lower-ranking player gets an easy ride with their team mates doing all the hard work.  By the same token 
			  someone with a streak of losses may actually be very good, but has been matched with lower-ranked teammates in 
			  an effort to balance the lobby. So Elo, which was designed for ranking one-on-one performance in chess, is not 
			  helpful here.
			  <br>
			  The game developers have their own combat rating which (while I don't know all the details) does 
			  take into account each player's individual performance and contribution to the match result. I decided 
			  this would be interesting to include in my analysis, and along with that we can also extract very 
			  precise and detailed data on the percentage of precision shots, which indicates skill, or the usage of 
			  particular weapon archetypes and character builds which suggest careful tuning of attributes and mods.
			  <br>
			  
			  
			  show current format -  it shows the data, but is it useful? does it help?
			  (sample private match, ask for vols to be in this and be happy to have their names displayed)
			  is this person cheating? very very difficult to say.
