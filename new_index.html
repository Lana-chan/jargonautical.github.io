  <h2>Making sense of data</h2>
	<h3>Back to basics</h3>
	<p>
		What do we mean by 'making sense of data'? It can't be that complicated. 
		Surely that's what graphs and stuff are for ... just shove your data into 
		some  kind of chart and the job is done, right?
	</p>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<div class="invisbox-wide">
			<p>
			  Not really. Data visualisation is about so much more than visualising data  
			  - it's crafting a message, a set of design choices around brand and audience, 
			  and most of all it's a response.
			  <br><br>
                          
			  A response to what? Well, it's kind of your job to figure that out. Here's what you need to be asking yourself.
			</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>What question does your chart answer?</li>
			  <li>What problem does it solve?</li>
			  <li>Who will look at it?</li>
			  <li>Will it help them to take action or make a decision?</li>
		  </ul>
		<p>To explore this point, here's an example using some data from one of my hobbies.</p>

				I spend several hours a week playing Destiny 2, an online MMORPG first-person shooter.
				Like many games in this genre it has a player-versus-player (PvP) mode where you can 
				test your skills against other players in a controlled arena separate from the main 
				story missions. Tensions run hot in this type of gameplay, and accusations of cheating are commonplace.
				<br>
				Being a middle-aged gamer with below-average reflexes I often come off worse in these competitions, and 
				of course that's very frustrating. Sometimes I find myself matched against people so skilled, so godly, that 
				I never stood a chance of beating them. 
				<br>
				When that happens I find myself hovering over the 'Report' button and 
				asking myself this question ...
			</p>
			<p class="hand4">"Do I really believe they're cheating - or am I just upset because I lost?".</p>

			<h4>Reinventing the wheel?</h4>
			<p>
				There are several support apps for Destiny 2, and they're each good 
				at different things. Inventory management apps let you access your gear and 
				resources while playing, to swap items over without having to return to a specific 
				location to access your vault. Others provide performance and ranking information 
				so you can see how you're doing and who you're up against. 
				<br><br>
				These are all good, but the performance trackers have a lot of blinking or scrolling 
				content - mostly adverts but also banners, buttons and links. It's a very cluttered interface 
				and not one I enjoy looking at or having open on a second screen while I'm trying to play.
				Also to get up-to-the-minute data you need to stay logged in constantly.

	<h3>There's a question to be answered!</h3>
	<div class="flex-container">
	  <div class="invisbox-wide">
		  
		  <p>
			  What I need is a simple visual look up that tells me at a glance whether 
				I'm justified in reporting a player or whether I just need to get over it.
			  <br><br>
			One thing that sets Destiny as a game apart from many others is its very rich, well-structured and 
			  well-documented API, hence the varied ecosystem of supporting apps and services. 
			  With a developer account I can access game data for myself and other 
			  players, and using that I can do pretty much any analysis that takes my fancy.
			  <br><br>
			  I started with an assumption: it should be possible to get some data to analyse who the likely cheats are in 
			  the games I'd played recently. That sort of thing would show up in their game statistics, right? Simple. 
			  All I needed to do was extract all of the game stats and then try out different models until I got an answer.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<div class="invisbox">
			<p>
				For the machine learning bit, I ran through various different model and data structures before admitting that, 
			        actually, I couldn't identify any meaningful pattern.
			        <br><br>
				What did the data tell me?
				<br><br>
				Good players tend to be good across competitive and casual game modes, and they play more matches. 
				They win more, they have a higher kills to deaths ratio (K/D), and more kills per game. They also do better 
				on the percentage of precision shots with difficult-to-master weapons like sniper rifles. 
				<br><br>
				Lots of these are 
				also what you'd expect to see if someone were cheating ... so what's the crucial indicator for high-skill 
				versus illegal mods? I couldn't see find it, even when I included individuals recently and very 
				publicly banned for using cheats.
				<br><br>
				And the more I tweaked the models, the more I lost sight of the problem I was originally trying to solve. 
				Exploring possible principal components for the k-means model shown on the right, 
				it looked like match duration and total team score (the number of kills by 
				everyone in the players team combined) were selected as the most significant 
				factors in whether that person was likely to be cheating. That clearly makes no sense in context!

		<div class="invisbox-big">
			
			<p>
				My models either made no sense at all, or were impossibly 100% efficient. Frequently both at once!
				<br><br>
				Thinking about all the factors I'd added to the model, it was obvious that <br><br>
				1. there were too many, and <br>
				2. most of them were redundant.<br>
				<br>
				For example: one factor which could and should be discounted was the player's class. 
				, but looking at the balance of classes in my data 
				I could see that frequent PvP players are more likely to play hunter, and several of my sample 
				group play ONLY on hunter and have no characters in either of the other classes. 
				<br><br>
				So that's both skewing my sample 
				and at the same time adding no useful information whatsoever.

			  So if my analysis isn't answering my question, what will? 
			  Time to go back and reframe the question. 
		  </p>
		  <p class="comment">
			  Should I have expected this person to beat me?<br>
			  Signs for that include:
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>Are they using the meta?</li>
			  <li>Are they are using known exploits?</li>
			  <li>Are they using particlar exotic weapons or armour?</li>
			  <li>Are they at a significantly higher level than me?</li>
		  </ul>
			  If one or more of those things is true, perhaps I just need to 'git gud' ...

	  <div class="invisbox-small">
		  <p class="hand4">So ... what do I really want to know here?</p>

			  One way to explore possible answers to these questions is to look at someone's game history 
			  to see whether their win status or their kill count seems feasible.
			  <br><br>
			  How do we do this?
			  <br><br>
			  Tracker apps usually start with a player's Elo ranking, which I find unhelpful. 
			  because it only counts wins and losses. Win a game and you move up, lose a game and you move down. 
			  In a multiplayer activity where there can be (depending on match settings) up to six players per team, it's  
			  too blunt an instrument. 
			  <br><br>
			  For example, someone with a high Elo could simply have been teamed up with very high-skill players - a 'carry', 
			  where the less-skilled player gets an easy ride with their team mates doing all the hard work.  By the same token 
			  someone with a streak of losses may actually be very good, but has been repeatedly matched with lower-ranked teammates in 
			  an effort to balance the lobby. So Elo, which was designed for ranking one-on-one performance in chess, is not 
			  helpful here.
			  <br><br>
			  Destiny 2 players are instead assigned a 'combat rating' which takes into account 
			  each player's individual performance and contribution to the match result. 
			  Along with that we can also access very 
			  detailed data on the percentage of precision shots, which indicates skill, or the usage of 
			  particular weapon archetypes and character builds which suggest careful tuning of attributes.
			  <br><br>
			  The chart to the right shows what some of that data looks like when plotted against kill 
			  count and all-time per-game average.

<h4>Working out how to frame it</h4>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<div class="invisbox">
			
			<p>
				Looking at some of these stats in a quick look up, one card per player, it could be helpful. Certainly 
				having the per-game average to compare to the match in question seems like a useful indicator 
				of unusual circumstances which might point to cheating.
				<br><br>
				But is this the right way to display it? Are the colours informative, or just distracting? Are the items in 
				a logical or intuitive order for the reader?
				<br><br>
				Now we're into design territory.

<h4>Designing the thing</h4>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<div class="invisbox-big">
			<p>
				we want the better/worse. comparisons to be obvious at a glance. Is this person 
				doing much, much better than they normally would? Then we have three dimensions to convey.
				<br><br>
				1. direction of travel (better/worse)<br>
				2. the extent of the difference (big/small), and <br>
				2. a value judgement (good/bad) perhaps assigned to colours
				<br><br>
				We could use a single symbol for all three dimensions. An up-arrow or down- arrows to convey direction, 
				a colour to represent good/bad, and the arrow size relative to the difference between this match and the usual average.
				<br><br>
				Or we could have a small plot showing the difference, leave out the colours and let the x-axis position or 
				the labelling indicate which is this match and which is the usual average.
				<br><br>
				Finally we could use text formatting. the colour of the text or its background could represent 
				good/bad, and the font size could be relative to the difference.
