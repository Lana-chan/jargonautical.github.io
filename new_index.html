  <h2>Making sense of data</h2>

		  <p>
			  What do we mean by 'making sense of data'? It can't be that complicated. 
			  Surely that's what graphs and stuff are for ... just shove your data into 
			  some  kind of chart and the job is done, right?
			  <br>
			  As it turns out - no, not really.
			  <br>
			  Data visualisation is about so much more than visualising data. 
			  It's a commmunication, a set of design choices around brand and audience, 
			  and most of all it's a response.
			  <br>
			  What question does your chart answer?<br>
			  What problem does it solve?<br>
			  Who will look at it and as a result feel ready to take action or make a decision?<br>
			  <br>
			  To explore this point, here's an example using some data from my real life.
			  I spend several hours a day playing Destiny 2, an online MMORPG first-person shooter.
			  Like many games in this genre it has a player-versus-player (PvP) mode where you can 
			  test your skills against other players in a controlled arena separate from the main 
			  story missions. Tensions run hot in this type of mode, and accusations of cheating are commonplace.
			  <br>
			  Being a middle-aged gamer with below-average reflexes, I frequently come off worse in these competitions, and 
			  of course that's very frustrating. Sometimes I find myself matched against people so skilled, so godly, that 
			  I never stood a chance of beating them. When that happens I find myself hovering over the 'Report' button and 
			  asking myself, 'Do I really believe they're cheating, or am I just salty about losing?'.

		  <h4>There's a question to be answered!</h4>
		  <p>
			One thing that sets Destiny as a game apart from many others is its very rich, well-structured and 
			  well-documented API. With a developer account I can access huge amounts of game data for myself and other 
			  players, and using that I can do any analysis I'd like.
			  <br>
			  I wondered if it would be possible to extract the right data to analyse who the likely cheats are in 
			  the games I'd played recently. That sort of thing would show up in their game statistics, right? Simple. 
			  All I needed to do was extract all of the game stats and then try some different models until I got an answer.
			  
			  For the machine learning bit, I ran through various different model and data structures before admitting that, 
			  actually, I couldn't identify any particular pattern.
			  <br>
			  This just in - good players tend to be good, more at ten.
			  <br>
			  And the more I tweaked the models, the more I lost sight of the problem I was originally trying to solve. 
			  I also developed immense sympathy for the developers who work on anti-cheat tools!

		  <p>
			  So if my analysis isn't answering my question, what does? 
			  Time to go back and reframe the question. 
			  <br>
		  </p>
		  <h4>What do I want to know?</h4>
		  <p>
			  Firstly: should I have expected this person to beat me?<br>
			  Signs for that include:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>Are they using the meta?</li>
			  <li>Are they are using known  exploits?</li>
			  <li>Are they at a significantly higher level than me?</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>
			  If one or more of those things is true, perhaps I just need to 'git gud' ...

		  <p>
			  what i can do though, is see from someone's play history whether their win or their kill count seems feasible
			  elo - not a useful ranking (explain why)
			  someone with lots of wins could have spent a lot of time being caried to wins by better players
			  someone with a streak of losses might have been trying to compensate for lower-ranked teammates
			  game devs have their own combat rating which takes into account individual performance
			  we can also look at % precision shots, most successful weapons or most used weapons
			  show current format -  it shows the data, but is it useful? does it help?
			  I don;t know because I'm not sure any more what the question is.
			  (sample private match, ask for vols to be in this and be happy to have their names displayed)
			  is this person cheating? very very difficult to say.
			  existing trackers - great at pulling out info but use ELO and also have
			  lots of ads and moving banners. plus you need to stay logged in so you can get your results faster.
			  my version will be simple look up with my own data already loaded and ready to call on
			  (show new version once I have this done)
