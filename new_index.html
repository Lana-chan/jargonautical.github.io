  <h2>Making sense of data</h2>
  <div class="flex-container">

      <p>
	  What do we mean by 'making sense of data'? It can't be that complicated. 
	  Surely that's what graphs and stuff are for ... just shove your data into 
	  some  kind of chart and the job is done, right?
	      
	  As it turns out - no, not really.
	      
	  Data visualisation is about so much more than visualising data. 
	  It's a commmunication, a set of design choices around brand and audience, 
	  and most of all it's a response. 
	      
	  What question does your chart answer?
	  What problem does it solve?
	  Who will look at it and as a result feel ready to take action or make a decision?
	      
	  To explore this point, here's an example using some data from my real life.
	  I spend several hours a day playing Destiny 2, an online MMORPG first-person shooter.
	  Like many games in this genre it has a player-versus-player (PvP) mode where you can 
	  test your skills against other players in a controlled arena separate from the main 
	  story missions. Tensions run hot in this type of mode, and accusations of cheating are commonplace.
	      
	  Being a middle-aged gamer with below-average reflexes, I frequently come off worse in these competitions, and 
	  of course that's very frustrating. Sometimes I find myself matched against people so skilled, so godly, that 
	  I never stood a chance of beating them. When that happens I find myself hovering over the 'Report' button and 
	  asking myself, 'do I really believe they're cheating? or am I just salty about losing?'.

		  i thought i could use this to see who the likely cheats are so i could report them
		  as it turns out it's not that easy
		  collected loads of data, ran a few ML models, nothing coherent. new sympathy for people who have to create anti-cheat software
		  
		  what i can do though, is see from someone's play history whether their win or their kill count seems feasible
		  
		  elo - not a useful ranking (explain why)
		  someone with lots of wins could have spent a lot of time being caried to wins by better players
		  someone with a streak of losses might have been trying to compensate for lower-ranked teammates
		  
		  game devs have their own combat rating which takes into account individual performance
		  we can also look at % precision shots, most successful weapons or most used weapons
		  
		  show current format -  it shows the data, but is it useful? does it help?
		  I don;t know because I'm not sure any more what the question is.
		  
		  (sample private match, ask for vols to be in this and be happy to have their names displayed)
		  
		  is this person cheating? very very difficult to say.
should I have expected to have been beaten by this person?
are they using the meta?
are there signs that they are using known  exploits?
or do i in fact just need to git gud ...

existing trackers - great at pulling out info but use ELO and also have
lots of ads and moving banners. plus you need to stay logged in so you can get your results faster.
my version will be simple look up with my own data already loaded and ready to call on

(show new version once I have this done)
