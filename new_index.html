	      what do we mean, 'making sense of data'?
surely that's what graphs and stuff are for. bung your data in some  kind of chart and  the job is done.

not really.

what question does your chart answer?
what problem does it solve?
who will look at it and as a result feel ready to take action or make a decision?

an example using d2 pvp stats
i thought i could use this to see who the likely cheats are so i could report them
as it turns out it's not that easy
collected loads of data, ran a few ML models, nothing coherent. new sympathy for people who have to create anti-cheat software

what i can do though, is see from someone's play history whether their win or their kill count seems feasible

elo - not a useful ranking (explain why)
someone with lots of wins could have spent a lot of time being caried to wins by better players
someone with a streak of losses might have been trying to compensate for lower-ranked teammates

game devs have their own combat rating which takes into account individual performance
we can also look at % precision shots, most successful weapons or most used weapons

show current format -  it shows the data, but is it useful? does it help?
I don;t know because I'm not sure any more what the question is.
(sample private match, ask for vols to be in this and be happy to have their names displayed)

is this person cheating? very very difficult to say.
should I have expected to have been beaten by this person?
are they using the meta?
are there signs that they are using known  exploits?
or do i in fact just need to git gud ...

existing trackers - great at pulling out info but use ELO and also have
lots of ads and moving banners. plus you need to stay logged in so you can get your results faster.
my version will be simple look up with my own data already loaded and ready to call on

(show new version once I have this done)
