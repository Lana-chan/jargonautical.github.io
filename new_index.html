  <h2>Making sense of data</h2>
	<div class="flex-container">

		<h4>Back to basics</h4>
			<p>
			  What do we mean by 'making sense of data'? It can't be that complicated. 
			  Surely that's what graphs and stuff are for ... just shove your data into 
			  some  kind of chart and the job is done, right?
			  As it turns out - no, not really.
			  Data visualisation is about so much more than visualising data. 
			  It's crafting a message, a set of design choices around brand and audience, 
			  and most of all it's a response.
			  <b>A response to what?</b>
			  Well, it's kind of your job to figure that out.
			</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>What question does your chart answer?</li>
			  <li>What problem does it solve?</li>
			  <li>Who will look at it?</li>
			  <li>Will it help them to take action or make a decision?</li>
		  </ul>
		<p>To explore this point, here's an example using some data from one of my hobbies.</p>

			<h4>First, find some data</h4>
			<p>
				I spend several hours a week playing Destiny 2, an online MMORPG first-person shooter.
				Like many games in this genre it has a player-versus-player (PvP) mode where you can 
				test your skills against other players in a controlled arena separate from the main 
				story missions. Tensions run hot in this type of gameplay, and accusations of cheating are commonplace.
				<br>
				Being a middle-aged gamer with below-average reflexes I often come off worse in these competitions, and 
				of course that's very frustrating. Sometimes I find myself matched against people so skilled, so godly, that 
				I never stood a chance of beating them. 
				<br>
				When that happens I find myself hovering over the 'Report' button and 
				asking myself this question ...
			</p>
			<h5>'Do I really believe they're cheating, or am I just salty about losing?'.</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h4>Reinventing the wheel?</h4>
			<p>
				There are many existing tracker sites and apps for Destiny 2, and they're each good 
				at different things. Inventory management apps let you access your gear and 
				resources while playing, to swap items over without having to return to aa specific 
				lcoaation to access your vaault. Others provide performance and ranking information 
				so you can see how you're doing and who you're up against. 
				<br><br>
				These are all good, but the trackers in particular tend to have a lot of blinking or scrolling 
				content - mostly adverts but also banners, buttons and links. It's a very cluttered interface 
				and not one I enjoy looking at or having open oin a second screen while I'm trying to play.
				
				Added to that, to get up-to-the-minute data I would need to stay logged in constantly. 
				<br><br>I need something much more basic than that - a simple visual look up that tells me at a glance whether 
				I'm justified in reporting a player or whether I just need to get over it.

		  <h4>There's a question to be answered!</h4>
		  <p>
			One thing that sets Destiny as a game apart from many others is its very rich, well-structured and 
			  well-documented API, hence the varied ecosystem of supporting apps and services. 
			  With a developer account I can access game data for myself and other 
			  players, and using that I can do pretty much any analysis that takes my fancy.
			  <br><br>
			  This is a very dangerous scenario for any data scientist. All this data, and no clear question in mind ...
			  <br><br>
			  I wondered if it would be possible to extract the right data to analyse who the likely cheats are in 
			  the games I'd played recently. That sort of thing would show up in their game statistics, right? Simple. 
			  All I needed to do was extract all of the game stats and then try some different models until I got an answer.
			  <br><br>
			  For the machine learning bit, I ran through various different model and data structures before admitting that, 
			  actually, I couldn't identify any meaningful pattern.
			  <br><br>
			  <b>This just in - good players tend to be good, more at ten.</b>
			  <br><br>
			  And the more I tweaked the models, the more I lost sight of the problem I was originally trying to solve.

			<h4>Something isn't right here ...</h4>
			<p>
				My models either made no sense at all, or were far too efficient. 
				Exploring possible principal components for the k-means model shown on the right, 
				it looked like match duration and total team score (the number of kills by 
				everyone in the players team combined) have been selected as the most significant 
				factors in whether that person was likely to be cheating. That clearly makes no sense in context!
				<br><br>
				Thinking about all the factors I'd added to the model, it was obvious that <br>
				1. there were too many, and <br>
				2. most of them were redundant.<br>
				<br><br>
				One factor which could and should be discounted was the player's class. 
				In Destiny 2 you can play as one of three classes; Titan, Warlock or Hunter. Each has its 
				advantages and disadvantages, but looking at the balance of classes in my data 
				I could see that frequent PvP players are more likely to play hunter, and several of my sample 
				group play ONLY on hunter and have no characters in either of the other classes. 
				<br><br>
				So that's both skewing my sample 
				and at the same time adding no useful information whatsoever.

		  <h4>Lie down, try not to cry, cry anyway ...</h4>
		  <p>
			  So if my analysis isn't answering my question, what will? 
			  Time to go back and reframe the question. 
		  </p>
		  <h4>What do I really want to know?</h4>
		  <p>
			  Firstly: should I have expected this person to beat me?<br>
			  Signs for that include:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>Are they using the meta?</li>
			  <li>Are they are using known exploits?</li>
			  <li>Are they using particlar exotic weapons or armour?</li>
			  <li>Are they at a significantly higher level than me?</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>
			  If one or more of those things is true, perhaps I just need to 'git gud' ...

		  <p>
			  One way to explore possible answers to these questions is to look at someone's game history 
			  to see whether their win status or their kill count seems feasible. Some  of the other tracker 
			  sites include a player's Elo ranking, which many take as a relevant metric. I prefer not to, however, 
			  and here's why. It only counts wins and losses. Win a game, and you move up.  Lose a game and you move down. 
			  In a team game, where there can be (depending on the specific mode) 4 or 6 players on each side, it's far 
			  too blunt an instrument. 
			  <br>
			  Someone with a high success rate could simply have been teamed up with very high-skill players - a 'carry', 
			  where the lower-ranking player gets an easy ride with their team mates doing all the hard work.  By the same token 
			  someone with a streak of losses may actually be very good, but has been matched with lower-ranked teammates in 
			  an effort to balance the lobby. So Elo, which was designed for ranking one-on-one performance in chess, is not 
			  helpful here.
			  <br>
			  The game developers have their own combat rating which (while I don't know all the details) does 
			  take into account each player's individual performance and contribution to the match result. I decided 
			  this would be interesting to include in my analysis, and along with that we can also extract very 
			  precise and detailed data on the percentage of precision shots, which indicates skill, or the usage of 
			  particular weapon archetypes and character builds which suggest careful tuning of attributes and mods.

			<h4>Working out how to frame it</h4>
			<p>
				Looking at some of these stats in a quick look up, one card per player, it could be helpful. Certainly 
				having the per-game average to compare to the match in question seems like a useful indicator 
				of unusual circumstances which might point to cheating.
				But is this the right way to display it? Are the colours informative, or just distracting? Are the items in 
				a logical or intuitive order for the reader?
				<br>
				Now we're into design territory.
